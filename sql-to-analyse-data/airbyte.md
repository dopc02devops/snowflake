## host.docker.internal
If you have a database, API, or any service running on your local machine, you can use host.docker.internal instead of manually finding the host's IP.
If you're running Kind and need your Kubernetes pods to communicate with a local service on your machine, you can use host.docker.internal as the hostname.

## Database Setup:
PostgreSQL as Source: To use PostgreSQL as a source, configure your connection settings to point to your local PostgreSQL instance or a remote database. Ensure the necessary credentials, database name, and host details are correctly set.

## ClickHouse as Destination: 
If you're using ClickHouse as the destination, configure your system to connect to the ClickHouse database where the data will be stored. Ensure you specify the correct host, port, username, and password for the ClickHouse instance.
